The hike log has basic CRUD functionality and styling meant to make testing and integration easier. feel free to mess around with it as much as you like.
All it needs is to be made persistent as now it is just using localstorage. to try it out follow the instructions below:

1. Open the project
2. git checkout trip-history
3. cd front_end
4. npm start

Hopefully that works if not shoot me a message on slack
